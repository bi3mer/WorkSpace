Hi, this is going to be my workspace where I post a bunch of solutions to problems that I come across while coding. It'll also have basic implementations like the first one up there being the Decorator pattern. I plan to add a complete solution set for the Coding Interview book in C, and see where I go from there.

ENjoy!
