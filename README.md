Hi, this is going to be my workspace where I post a bunch of solutions to problems that I come across while coding. It'll also have basic implementations like the first one up there being the Decorator pattern. I plan to add a complete solution set for the Coding Interview book in C, and see where I go from there.

For [cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) problems I will go out of my way to make each file one file so compiling and running will be relatively simple.

Enjoy!
